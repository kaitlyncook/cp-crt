## data Folder

---

This folder contains the data imported in the scripts **data-application.R** and **figure-table-generation.R**. Contents are as follows:

+ **simulated-bcpp.csv**: Simulated interim data patterned after the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP). Data were generated by using an agent-based epidemic model to propagate HIV infection on a simulated network of dynamic sexual partnerships (see [Goyal et al. (2013)](https://biostats.bepress.com/harvardbiostat/paper137/) and [Wang et al. (2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24651566/) for details). Variable names and descriptions are below.

| Variable Name | Description                                                       | Variable Type |

| pair.id       | Matched Pair ID                                                   | Integer: 1-15 |   
| treat         | Indicator of randomization to combination prevention              | Integer: 0-1  |   
| left          | Left endpoint of the censoring interval for HIV seroconversion  | Numeric       |   
| right         | Right endpoint of the censoring interval for HIV seroconversion | Numeric       |   

+ **"data/simulation-results/"**: Subfolder containing all .csv simulation output files, which are subsequently processed and used to generate all manuscript figures and tables in **figure-table-generation.R**.  Select variable names and descriptions  (shared across most results files) are below.
